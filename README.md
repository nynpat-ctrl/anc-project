https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oCJiSy8RA3yRemPYhNFnsf3aYMK5XGWrIXzB70qVHNE/edit#gid=0
* When turning in each assignment, complete a contribution form which needs to be cross signed by team members.
* Everyone is required to upload a team (identical) report.

Study a significant machine learning problem/tool/application.
* Explain how it work, best to demonstrate the basic working principle by an example
* Explain the structure of the problem solution approach and algorithm(s) employed
* Describe how to access the dataset, clearly specify the training and testing datasets (strongly encourage self-collected test datasets). Include results of both training and testing
* Describe step by step how to implement the solution (include all technical details, such as system requirements, software packages, setup procedure, data source, papers used for modeling after, and more)

In a nutshell, prepare your work to answer what, why and how questions on the subject you choose to study.

### Key requirements
* Your chosen project topic is timely, significant, and machine learning solutions are state-of-the-art.
* You are expected to illustrate by using an example (the simpler the better) how your approach works and it actually works.
 
### Due dates:
* Final project presentations (conference style, in class, ~6 presentations/day, 10 minutes/presentation): November 19 (Thursday), November 24 (Tuesday), December 1 (Tuesday) and December 3 (Thursday)
* Final report due: December 10, 5pm

## PC#0
> <strong>(2 points) PC#0. Problem statement due: Sept 11 (Friday) 11:59pm</strong>

Format: 1-page ppt to include
1. Concise description of the problem/application
2. Specific references (1. Papers and/or book chapters, 2. online open source datasets, 3. code…)
3. Expected outcomes (how are you going to demonstrate your results in the end?)
4. Specify who is going to do what for the upcoming PC#1.
5. Attach a credit report (separately) to specify who did what for this assignment. The form needs to be cross signed by all team members.

## PC#1
> <strong>(5 points) PC#1.  Progress check 1 due on Oct 2 (Friday) 11:59pm</strong>

> Report - [Status Report - Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/6557283433khvmttnqztzm)

1. Provide a concise, concrete and clear problem formulation (can be updated from the previous 1-pager to be more accurate). Aim at clearly explaining a theory/application/tool to the audience, demonstrating how it works, and describing your expected results (show-and-tell, use images and videos and other creative means). Avoid being too general or too narrow. 
2. Identify key literature, datasets (training and testing), implementation code.
3. Describe system requirement to establish the computation platform to demonstrate your project by answering the following questions: 1. Do you have sufficient resource to perform the computation, 2. How to install needed software environment, 3. Can you run the code without error. Provide clear evidence when answering the 3 questions in the report. 
4. Describe what examples you’re going to use for demonstration.
5. Summarize your progress to date in a report of no more than 3 pages (it is fine if you have 2 pages) in IEEE paper format. Clearly indicate what is under development and identify who is going to do what. 
6. Attach a credit report (separately) to specify who did what for this assignment. The form needs to be cross signed by all team members.

## PC#2
> <strong>(5 points) PC#2.  Progress check 2 due on Nov 6 (Friday) 11:59pm</strong>

> Report - [Status Report - Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/4984875892cvmrpssmcyph)

1. At this point, your key ingredients that go into the final report should be completely in place, although they may not in the most polished form yet.
2. Write-up: a 4 to 5-page report in IEEE paper publication format. 
3. Flesh out section by section your work in an IEEE publication format to include 1) abstract, 2) introduction, 3) methods, 4) implementation and simulation, 5) results, 6) discussions & conclusions. 7) references. Some of those sections may not be completely polished (take section 5 as an example, you should have obtained all the expected results but they may not be in complied form yet like those figures in an archival IEEE transactions paper). As another example, some sections in this report may be improved later but your outline of the section should be complete and in place. 
4. You should clearly specify what is still remaining to be done for the final report and who is going to do what. 
5. Attach a credit report (separately) to specify who did what for this assignment. The form needs to be cross signed by all team members.
